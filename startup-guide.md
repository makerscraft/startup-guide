> This is a WIP

Founding a startup is a bit like having a child. No matter what you do, you'll never adequately prepare yourself for the euphoric highs and devastating lows. Nobody is ever _ready_ to have their first child, yet people do it everyday. They decide that they want to be a parent, and they go do it. Even the most prepared new parents are subject to the occasional folly, but at least they probably understand what they _don't_ know about parenting.

A startup will test you in ways you could never imagine, so in that respect there's no point in over-studying before you jump in. That being said, the best way to prepare for the unexpected is understand what you _don't_ know, just like a new parent. This resource won't tell you how to build the next Google, but it will hopefully school you on not becoming the next [GovWorks, WebVan or eToys](http://www.businesspundit.com/25-internet-startups-that-bombed-miserably/).

## Phases

There are four phases during a startup that have a distinct feel. Phases do not have a defined time frame. You don't move to a new phase, a new phase moves you to it.

### Founding

Pure excitement. You have the idea for the next big thing, and you're going to execute. Watch out world, they'll be releasing my movie in 5 years.

* [Find an idea](http://paulgraham.com/startupideas.html)
* [Build the founding team](http://steveblank.com/2013/07/29/building-great-founding-teams/)

### Prototyping

* Building an MVP: Don't buy a domain name. Don't buy ads. Don't make a video. Don't pay a developer or designer to help you. These are all distractions. The idea that you have now, the one that is a game-changing, market disrupting, billion dollar product, is unfortunately going to change a great deal as you move forward. The only thing you be constant in startups is change, and you never want to be caught with two feet in the mud. Don't worry about how your product looks or what it doesn't do. Building an MVP is all about traction, and the only way to get traction is to do something better than someone else. It doesn't matter if your idea has a potential market size of $1,000. If you build something that can help yourself in a small way, you will gain traction. If it's truly useful to you, it _will_ be useful to someone else. That's the essence of the MVP - impose every possible constraint on yourself, and build something that you still find useful. Once you find it useful, find one more person who finds it useful. That's traction, and that's what an MVP is meant to generate.

Launch a startup, but understand what you don't know first. Everyone has ideas, but few have the resolve to act on them. You'll likely learn more during the first year of your startup than the rest of your education and professional life combined. Follow the advice outlined in this resource and you'll increase your odds at success, but more importantly, you'll decrease your odds of outright failure. Most importantly, build something that you would use. If you wouldn't use your product, you'll never convince someone else to.

Now go build something great.
